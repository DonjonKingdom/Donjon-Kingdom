<h1>Donjon Kingdom</h1>
<p>Donjon kingdom is a project created by me and my student team! We think we can create a game (style ACTION - RPG) about a magical world inside an another dimmension. We code by using the "Game Maker" software and we organize some meetings to talk about the project. Actually, we don't really make the game. We just makes starts menus, chatboxes, death title, ect. But make sure the project is in a good position because of our team. We have 17 students who give ideas, makes textures on paper, pixelised the textures, makes sounds, musics, and code the game. So, see you next time and hope you enjoy! TheYellowBush</p>
